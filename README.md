# ass-memoryGame
A very basic memory game implemented entirely in **ATMEL's Assembly** for **AVR-Microprocessors**. Ther player must match the **randomly-created LED** pattern shown by the microcontroller 
using four push-up buttons. Two additional LEDs indicate a pattern match (green) and mismatch (red). This is a video of a simulation using [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/):
